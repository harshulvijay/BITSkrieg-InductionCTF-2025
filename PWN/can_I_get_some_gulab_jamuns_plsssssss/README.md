# Can I get some gulab jamuns, Please?
As you know, the bhaiya at the mess only gives one gulab jamun to everyone — but that isn’t enough for me. I asked for more, and he sternly replied:

“You will only get one gulab jamun!”

Disappointed, I noticed something interesting: the bowl he was serving from overflowed with gulab jamuns, and one spilled over. Maybe I can exploit that little overflow to sneak a few more gulab jamuns for myself…
