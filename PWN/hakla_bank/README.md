# Hakla Bank

Welcome to **Hakla Bank** – the most "secure" bank in town… or so they claim.  
This bank protects the most valuable asset of this CTF: **THE FLAG!** 🏦🚩  

As a regular customer, you’re not supposed to access the admin’s vault.  
But rumor has it, their system isn’t as robust as they think.  

During a late-night heist, someone managed to smuggle out:  
- A copy of the bank’s **login program** (`hakla_bank`)  

Your mission:  
1. Analyze the program.  
2. Find a way to escalate your privileges.  
3. Gain **admin access**.  
4. Retrieve the **flag** from the vault.
