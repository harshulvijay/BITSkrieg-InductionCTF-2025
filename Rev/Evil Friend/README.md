# Evil Friend

My friend was playing around on my computer. He's known to mess around with everyone, so I can't leave him unsupervised around my devices. But I had to leave him alone for a while as I looked for my mail at the door.

When I came back, I saw he had used some command to encrypt a very important file of mine. I tried opening it, but there was a mysterious file inside. I can't read my data now! Can you please help me recover it?
