**Challenge: Flagception**
**Overview**
A .blend file (Blender project) is provided as the challenge artifact. It can be opened locally in Blender or previewed via online 3D viewers like imagetostl.com. The scene initially appears to contain random, floating 3D objects spread through space.

The objects are deliberately positioned in 3D so that, when viewed from the correct camera angle, they align to form the flag: 
InductionCTF{parallax_pals}
