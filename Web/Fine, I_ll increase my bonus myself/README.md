# Fine, I'll increase my bonus myself

It's employee review season. Everyone's nervous. The best performing employees will receive a big bonus from the company. But rumors are, even after working hard throughout the year and being a great employee overall, management has decided to give the Chief Security Guard a very low bonus compared to everyone else, and pocketed a major chunk themselves.

Little did they know, he knew about some major flaws in their in-house employee management system that no one else did... I mean what can you expect when you don't spend enough on good developers.
