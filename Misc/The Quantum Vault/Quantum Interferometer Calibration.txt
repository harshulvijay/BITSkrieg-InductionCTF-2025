Problem Statement:
You are tasked with calibrating a quantum interferometer by determining the phase shift it introduces to a specific quantum state.

Given Inputs:
Interferometer Element: A quantum interferometer component I that introduces either:
I₀: No phase shift (0 phase shift)
I_π: A π phase shift


Probe State: A qubit prepared in state |p⟩ with the following properties:
I₀|p⟩ = |p⟩ (state remains unchanged under zero phase shift)
I_π|p⟩ = -|p⟩ (state acquires minus sign under π phase shift)


Operation Properties: The interferometer element has adjoint and controlled variants available.


Task:
Determine the phase shift introduced by the interferometer element.


Output Requirements:
Return 0 if the element introduces no phase shift (I₀)
Return 1 if the element introduces π phase shift (I_π)


Additional Constraints:
The final state of the probe qubit does not matter
You may use auxiliary qubits as needed
The solution should work with a single query to the interferometer element
