Problem Statement
You are tasked with distinguishing between two possible single-qubit unitary transformations based on their action on a specific eigenstate.

Given Inputs:
Unitary Operation: A single-qubit unitary transformation that is either:
U₁: A unitary that preserves a specific eigenstate
U₋₁: A unitary that negates a specific eigenstate


Eigenstate: A qubit prepared in state |ψ⟩ with the following properties:
U₁|ψ⟩ = |ψ⟩ (eigenstate with eigenvalue +1)
U₋₁|ψ⟩ = -|ψ⟩ (eigenstate with eigenvalue -1)


Operation Properties: The given unitary operation has adjoint and controlled variants available.


Task
Determine which unitary transformation you have been given.


Output Requirements:
Return 0 if the given operation is U₁
Return 1 if the given operation is U₋₁


Additional Constraints:
The final state of the input qubit does not matter
You may use auxiliary qubits as needed
The solution should work with a single query to the unknown unitary.
